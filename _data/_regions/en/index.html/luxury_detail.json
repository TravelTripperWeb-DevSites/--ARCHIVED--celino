That&rsquo;s our new-fashioned oceanfront hideaway tucked into the scene of Ocean Drive. At the iconic Celino South Beach hotel, the eclectic range of 132 art deco inspired modern guestrooms, including our floor to ceiling ocean view suites with balconies and the exclusive rooftop glass bottom pool. Relax and re-energize at our courtyard pool and sun deck while enjoying a signature drink from the Dalia Bar. It&rsquo;s magical at all hours. All you have to do is stay.</p>\n</div>\n<p><a class=\"button button--arrow button--arrow--gold\" href=\"about/#hotel-amenities\">Amenities</a></p>",
