    "content": "<p>On Miami&rsquo;s Ocean Drive, this storied boutique hotel for mid-century stars like Bogart and Hayworth has long been the getaway from the Miami scene. Celino found a second life&ndash;and its current name&ndash;when we re-imagined it as a 132-room boutique hotel in 2019. Immersed in glamorous dramatic details, tropical foliage and nostalgic midcentury pieces situated around a plunge pool, and Ocean Drive dining, you&rsquo;ll find a new kind of glamour: We think dining al fresco calls for a cool Champagne Julep. Surrounded by vibrant city and ocean vistas the Celino hotel situated at 640 Ocean Drive is a seamless merger of historic Art Deco retrofit with a modern beachfront expansion. With a calm residential vibe, our boutique hotel blends tropical surroundings with modern d&eacute;cor and playful touches. Hey, the conga line was invented here after all. Yes, we do have drums in the rooms. Upon request of course.</p>\n<p>The Celino provides guests with a full selection of boutique hotel services and amenities. From our rooftop pool side bar and in-room dining to our concierge services, we make certain you have everything you need during your stay in Miami.</p>",
