Transport back in time with a visit to these historical hotspots.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Art Deco District</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Miami Beach saw rapid growth beginning in the 1920s, as hotels and mansions began popping up along Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive. The neighborhood came to be known as the Art Deco District and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Nearly 900 preserved buildings feature distinct &lsquo;Art Deco&rsquo; characteristics of clean lines, geometric patterns, nautical and tropical motifs, and bright colors. The iconic Ocean Drive is at the epicenter of the district, stretching from South Point (just south of 1st Street) to 15th Street. Walk the streets with our <a href=\"https://www.thecelinohotel.com/blog/art-deco-district-visitor-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Art Deco District Visitor&rsquo;s Guide</a> and book our <a href=\"https://www.thecelinohotel.com/offer/#deco-immersion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deco Immersion</a> package for a private walking tour of the historic district.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Lincoln Road Mall</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lincoln Road Mall became one of the nation&rsquo;s first pedestrian malls in 1912 and was home to retailers Saks Fifth Avenue, Bonwit Teller, Elizabeth Arden, Packard, and Cadillac. After many decades of growth and expansion, today the Mall remains a sprawling one-stop destination with over 200 shops, restaurants, galleries, the New World Center, Colony Theatre, and a multiplex cinema. Nearly 100 years after its inception, the Lincoln Road Mall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1569776858050\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1569776842/tm6v5cscvhwk1k0koise.jpg\" alt=\"holocaust-memorial-miami-beach\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1569776842/tm6v5cscvhwk1k0koise.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1569776842/tm6v5cscvhwk1k0koise.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1569776842/tm6v5cscvhwk1k0koise.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1569776842/tm6v5cscvhwk1k0koise.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1569776842/tm6v5cscvhwk1k0koise.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Holocaust Memorial</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Designed by acclaimed architect Kenneth Treister, the Holocaust Memorial pays tribute to the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Somber, impactful, and to the point, the thoughtfully crafted memorial serves as a link to loved ones lost. The memorial is adjacent to the Miami Beach Botanical Garden on Meridian Avenue.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Wolfsonian</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://wolfsonian.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolfsonian</a> museum, library, and research center in the heart of the Art Deco District explores the inventive and provocative character of the modern world. Discover how the past influences the present and shapes the future through unique artifacts and design. The Wolfsonian&rsquo;s collection includes nearly 180,000 pieces from 1885 to 1945, including furniture, ceramics, paintings, textiles, and industrial-design objects from a past era.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 1950, guests have traveled from around the world to the Miami Beach Municipal Auditorium to watch song and dance, comedy shows, boxing matches, Broadway performances, and concerts. Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, and Jack Benny were regular visitors to the beloved auditorium. After comedian Jackie Gleason filmed his show at the theater in the late 60s, the venue was subsequently renamed. Today, the <a href=\"http://www.fillmoremb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fillmore Miami Beach at the Jackie Gleason Theater</a> showcases the biggest names in live entertainment.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1569776921058\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1569776902/xjjfglrma0opudvh8j2z.jpg\" alt=\"monastery-miami-beach\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1569776902/xjjfglrma0opudvh8j2z.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1569776902/xjjfglrma0opudvh8j2z.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1569776902/xjjfglrma0opudvh8j2z.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1569776902/xjjfglrma0opudvh8j2z.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1569776902/xjjfglrma0opudvh8j2z.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Ancient Spanish Monastery</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Originally built in Segovia, Spain in 1141, newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst purchased the monastery&rsquo;s cloisters and outbuildings in 1925, dismantled them stone-by-stone, and shipped them to the United States. After the painstaking project of reassembling the structure, the monastery is reportedly the oldest building in the Western Hemisphere. Visit the North Miami Beach monastery daily from 10 a.m. - 4 p.m. (Sundays, 11 a.m. - 4 p.m.).</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Collins Canal</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Often credited with getting Miami Beach started, the historic Collins Canal was constructed by pioneer John Collins to transport avocados and mangos from his farm to ships in Biscayne Bay. The canal celebrated its 100th birthday in 2012. Today, the Collins Canal is used mainly for recreational purposes. Catch a glimpse of the historic waterway with a visit to the Miami Beach Botanical Garden.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Celino Hotel</h4>\n<p>Celino Hotel&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.thecelinohotel.com/blog/celino-hotel-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rich history</a> is deeply rooted in the Art Deco movement in South Beach.
