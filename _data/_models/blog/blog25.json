Let&rsquo;s take a look at how Miami went from an emerging fashion capital to an undeniable force on the world stage. From discovering up-and-coming designers to shopping for the latest trends, here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about Miami&rsquo;s vibrant fashion scene.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">A Brief History</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What began in the 1950s and 60s as a bustling manufacturing sector in neighborhoods north of Downtown, Miami&rsquo;s fashion scene propelled swiftly. The influx of Cuban refugees helped drive Miami&rsquo;s garment industry. Pattern makers, sewers, and textile laborers worked in the warehouses of Wynwood, Hialeah, and Allapattah. Successful Miami designers soon emerged and the uptick of brands headquartered in Miami continues today.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Designers</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Young, international designers helped put Miami on the map. Lazaro Hernandez, Alejandro Ingelmo, and Gelareh Mizrahi all got their start in Miami and continue to push fashion boundaries. <a href=\"https://krelwear.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Karelle Levy</a>, <a href=\"https://sealily.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Charlotte Althin Hicks</a>, and Julian Chang have all set up shop in Miami. Most famously, Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace made his home on Ocean Drive in South Beach in 1992 until his death.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Model Agencies</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Designers aren&rsquo;t the only ones putting down roots in Miami. Worldwide Model Agencies like Elite Model Management, MC2 Models, and Wilhelmina Models have set up an office in Magic City. Local agencies The Green Agency, Front Management, and Deco Models have been providing Miami and international markets with the freshest new faces in the industry.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Shops</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to luxury boutiques and designer stores, Miami&rsquo;s downtown retail scene continues to grow. Visit the Brickell City Centre, Bayside Marketplace, and The Shops at Mary Brickell Village for the latest designs in fashion. The Design District is an excellent place to stroll the streets for high-end shops. Maison Margiela, En Avance, Christian Louboutin and more big name designers call the Design District home.
