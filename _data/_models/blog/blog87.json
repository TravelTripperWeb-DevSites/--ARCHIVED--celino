Make sure to visit the famous <a href=\"https://www.doleplantation.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dole Plantation</a> during your stay in Oahu. It&rsquo;s just a 40-minute ride from Waikiki and one of the island&rsquo;s major attractions. Here&rsquo;s five reasons you don&rsquo;t want to miss out on the Dole Plantation.</p>\n<h3>1. It&rsquo;s home to the world&rsquo;s biggest maze</h3>\n<p>With nearly 2.5 miles of pathways, the pineapple garden maze has been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the largest maze in the world. To be exact, it&rsquo;s a botanical maze, made up of over 14,000 plant species. There are plenty of shortcuts, but we recommend you challenge yourself and only use the map.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. You can ride the Pineapple Express Train</h3>\n<p>Tour the plantation with this 20-minute ride aboard a vintage-style train. You&rsquo;ll learn about the history of the pineapple empire and see glimpses of Hawaii&rsquo;s North Shore.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3. Its lush gardens</h3>\n<p>Walk through the plantation&rsquo;s small gardens, which are teeming with native species, such as the Hawaiian state flower, the yellow hibiscus (pua aloalo). Plumeria also grow in a specific section of the gardens, as well as a wide variety of bromeliads. See banana trees and other stunning plant species before visiting the koi pond, which is a nice place to sit and relax.</p>\n<h3>4. Dole Whip</h3>\n<p>Chances are you&rsquo;ve seen this on menus across Waikiki, but you have to try it from the source! Dole Whip is a frozen treat made with pineapple and coconut milk, and it&rsquo;s just about as good as everyone says. Order a cone or a cup of this frozen treat &ndash; your trip isn&rsquo;t complete until you&rsquo;ve tasted the famous Dole Whip.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>5. Pineapple-themed souvenirs</h3>\n<p><img id=\"1542650047675\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_884_21252/media/2018-11-19-125320/large_pineapple-plush-hawaii-dole.jpg\" alt=\"pineapple-plush-hawaii-dole\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_884_21252/media/2018-11-19-125320/large_pineapple-plush-hawaii-dole.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_884_21252/media/2018-11-19-125320/medium_pineapple-plush-hawaii-dole.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_884_21252/media/2018-11-19-125320/small_pineapple-plush-hawaii-dole.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_884_21252/media/2018-11-19-125320/xsmall_pineapple-plush-hawaii-dole.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_884_21252/media/2018-11-19-125320/thumb_pineapple-plush-hawaii-dole.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The pineapple souvenirs in the gift shop are just so cute it&rsquo;s hard to say no. There&rsquo;s chocolate-covered pineapple, mini canned plush pineapples, pineapple soap and pineapple gummy bears, to name a few &ndash; plus you can purchase some Dole Farms coffee in bulk, which makes for a great gift.</p>\n<h3>How to get there from Waikiki</h3>\n<p>If traveling by car, get on H-1 West, then transfer to H-2 North (via exit 8A). From H-2, take exit 8 to Wahiawa and continue to Kamehameha Highway (99). The plantation will be on your right at 64-1550 Kamehameha Highway.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re using public transportation, board bus 8, 19, 20, 23, or 42 from the stop located at Kuhio and Liliuokalani avenues. Take the bus to the <a href=\"https://www.astonwaikikibeach.com/activities/shopping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ala Moana Shopping Center</a>, where you&rsquo;ll ask the driver for a transfer to the Dole Plantation.</p>\n<p>--&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to visit the Dole Plantation? <a href=\"mailto:AstonWaikikiBeach-Concierge@pleasant.net\">Plan a visit</a> through Pleasant Holidays travel agency, located on-site at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel.
