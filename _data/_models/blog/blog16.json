Take charge of your self-imposed state! The below recommendations are all in or around Celino Hotel so you won&rsquo;t have to add the hassle of travel to your already pounding headache. Here are a few ways to nurse yourself back to optimum health after a night out in South Beach.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Spend the Day at the Beach</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enjoy some good old fashioned vitamin sea. Warm weather, sandy beaches, and ocean breezes are a cure in itself. Grab a beach towel, lie on the sand, and let nature heal. Take a dip in the warm waters of Miami Beach. Salt water and sunny weather can draw out toxins and provide some much-needed vitamin D, magnesium, and oxygen. Let the salty water brighten, detoxify, and clean out your pores. Celino Hotel&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.thecelinohotel.com/explore/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proximity to the beach</a> makes it easy.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Eat Something</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Embrace your hangover in the most enjoyable of ways - eating delicious food.
