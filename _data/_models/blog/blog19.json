  "more_content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">From island condos overlooking the ocean to the most prestigious residential street in Mid-Beach, Miami has long held appeal for celebrities who like to have a place (one of them at least) by the beach. Miami is an amazing city to settle down in and these celebrities obviously agree. Here are some of Miami&rsquo;s well-known residents and ex-residents that call Magic City home.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">1. Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jennifer Lopez has owned several residences in Miami throughout the years, including a condo in South Beach and a beautiful mansion on North Bay Drive in Mid-Beach. The actress, singer, dancer, fashion designer, producer, and businesswoman was presented the keys to Miami Beach only a few weeks ago, and July 24 has forevermore been declared &ldquo;Jennifer Lopez Day&rdquo;. Lopez and fianc&eacute;, former MLB player Alexander Rodriguez, reside in Coral Gables. The 11,000-square-foot home accentuates an indoor-outdoor feel, with retracting window walls that lift up to showcase the sprawling yard, swimming pool, freestanding bar pavilion, and in-ground trampoline.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">2. Shakira</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Colombian singer also lived on the celebrity-filled North Bay Road Drive in Miami Beach. The modern, six-bedroom residence has direct access to Biscayne Bay, complete with a heated pool, hookah lounge, cabana, and &ldquo;Grand Room&rdquo; with abundant light. North Bay Drive is a short drive from the action in Miami Beach, but its privacy and exclusivity make it one of the most sought-after neighborhoods for the mega rich.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1565660020318\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1565660016/gq7b3hfpvhmawegc4jbj.jpg\" alt=\"phil-collins\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1565660016/gq7b3hfpvhmawegc4jbj.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1565660016/gq7b3hfpvhmawegc4jbj.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1565660016/gq7b3hfpvhmawegc4jbj.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1565660016/gq7b3hfpvhmawegc4jbj.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1565660016/gq7b3hfpvhmawegc4jbj.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">3. Phil Collins</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The English singer-songwriter bought Jennifer Lopez&rsquo;s North Bay Road waterfront estate. The contemporary European-style home features seven bedrooms, a koi pond, wine cellar, spa, and stunning views of the Miami skyline. The sophisticated property is lined with palms and lush gardens, giving privacy to the mansion on the busy Biscayne Bay.</p>\n<h4>4. Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Iglesias and Kournikova live in a 20,000-square-foot home on Millionaire&rsquo;s Row. The Grammy-award winning &ldquo;King of Latin Pop&rdquo; and retired pro tennis player reside in the Bay Point community, one of the most coveted communities in all of South Florida. Their $26 million waterfront home has a tennis court and beautiful sapphire-tinged lap pool and jacuzzi.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1565660060515\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1565660057/ba4pgctukdlbw7vffho0.jpg\" alt=\"oprah\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1565660057/ba4pgctukdlbw7vffho0.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1565660057/ba4pgctukdlbw7vffho0.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1565660057/ba4pgctukdlbw7vffho0.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1565660057/ba4pgctukdlbw7vffho0.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1565660057/ba4pgctukdlbw7vffho0.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">5. Oprah</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &ldquo;Queen of All Media&rdquo; once had a condo on Fisher Island, the most expensive zip code in Florida and a members-only island where residents pay $250,000 just for access. The exclusive 216-acre, man-made island can only be reached by boat. Her $2-million Seaside Village condo had spectacular ocean views, custom wood built-ins, marble floors, and a large seaside terrace.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">6. Shaquille O'Neal</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shaquille \"Shaq\" O'Neal, former NBA player and current sports analyst, previously lived on Star Island.

Ricky Martin</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Puerto Rican pop singer once owned a Mediterranean-style Miami Beach mansion overlooking Downtown from North Bay Road. The 4-bedroom house is known for its saltwater pool, multiple guest houses, and majestic banyan trees, one estimated at being over 100 years old.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">8.

Gianni Versace</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although his story ended in tragedy, we couldn&rsquo;t leave Miami&rsquo;s most arguably famous house off the list. Versace&rsquo;s mansion on Ocean Drive underwent a staggering $32 million renovation after the Italian fashion designer purchased the house in 1992. Demolishing the adjacent Revere Hotel to make way for a pool, garden, and south wing, Versace lived in ultimate luxury until he was tragically shot and killed outside the home in 1997. Today the mansion operates as a hotel and <a href=\"http://vmmiamibeach.com/gianni/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">restaurant</a>. Make a reservation for dinner at this historic mansion and dine while overlooking the pool lined with 24-karat gold tiles.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">10. Gloria Estefan</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Cuban-American singer-songwriter arrived in Miami from Cuba and has been a singing sensation in America since the 80s. Her life has always stayed closely linked to Miami, including her award-winning Cuban restaurant <a href=\"http://lariosonthebeach.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Larios on the Beach</a> on Ocean Drive. Today, the Latin singing sensation lives on Star Island.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Live among the stars when you book your South Beach getaway with Celino Hotel, located in the heart of Miami Beach.
