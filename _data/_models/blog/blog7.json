After extensive renovations of the landmark Park Central Hotel, Imperial Hotel, and Heathcote Apartments along Ocean Drive, the new Celino Hotel was born. But its history as South Beach&rsquo;s premier hotel goes much further back. Let us take a step back in time and investigate the Celino Hotel&rsquo;s past.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Origins</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At a time when South Beach was undergoing an Art Deco renaissance, master architect Henry Hohauser completed the Park Central Hotel in 1937. Once a popular hangout for stars Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Carol Lombard, and Rita Hayworth, Park Central Hotel and Ocean Drive eventually fell into decline. Decades later, after recognizing Ocean Drive as &lsquo;America&rsquo;s Riviera&rsquo;, real estate developer Tony Goldman acquired the property in 1985 and Park Central underwent a spectacular rebirth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The hotel went on to become a beacon in the fashion industry and helped fuel a second South Beach renaissance. Named the 100th member of the prestigious Historic Hotels of America in 1993, Park Central Hotel&rsquo;s legacy lives on.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Within the walls of the hotel and the adjoining buildings, progress was possible. Heathcote Apartments, the Imperial Hotel designed in 1939 by &ldquo;principal architect of Deco South Beach&rdquo; L. Murray Dixon, and the historic Park Central Hotel were combined to form one cohesive masterpiece along Ocean Drive.</p>\n<p><img id=\"1559084932191\" class=\" \" src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1559084928/qg0ufey918gq2hheviby.jpg\" alt=\"celino-interior\" data-image-large=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_1200,w_1200/v1559084928/qg0ufey918gq2hheviby.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_992,w_992/v1559084928/qg0ufey918gq2hheviby.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_768,w_768/v1559084928/qg0ufey918gq2hheviby.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fit,h_300,w_300/v1559084928/qg0ufey918gq2hheviby.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//res.cloudinary.com/traveltripperweb/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,h_140,w_140/v1559084928/qg0ufey918gq2hheviby.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The New Celino District</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ocean Drive&rsquo;s location, history, and charm inspired Ricardo Tabet to reinvent the identity of South Beach&rsquo;s most iconic street with the establishment of the new <a href=\"https://www.thecelinohotel.com/blog/discover-celino-district/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Celino District</a>.
